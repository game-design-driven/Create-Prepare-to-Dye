* anvil_no_level_limit. Anvil might be removed soon but until then there should not be a limit ([af18bd3](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/commit/af18bd31e31d16074723b00b79b22be476ccfe80))
* Gold is 4 nuggets ([b821b77](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/commit/b821b7760ec4a8f86335f0d3fd754659f5ea7a50))

* remove furnace! It's not needed and less interesting than other options. A bit misleading too as it leads players to more difficult solutions ([f696b4e](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/commit/f696b4ea89f07f1f57a339d5e0ea7a6c21c74dc1))
