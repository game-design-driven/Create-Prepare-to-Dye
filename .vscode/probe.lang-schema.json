To use an equipped _Ring of Loki_, begin by sneak-righting click a block with an empty hand. Once a block is selected (designated the \"origin\"), sneak-right clicking other blocks will store their offsets from the origin in the ring. To finish the procedure, sneak-right click the origin again. Sneak-right clicking a stored block during the selection process will remove it from the ring's memory. To clear a completed selection, just sneak-right click the ground twice. After the selection is complete, multiple boxes in wireframe will be visible, moving relative to the looked-at block. When a block is placed while sneaking, all wireframe locations will have blocks placed there, too, allowing for placement _en masse_.

Approaching one of these will activate it; it shows its radius of effect when active. While activated, the index will intercept _Chat Messages_ from nearby players, processing them into _requests_ and preventing them from being broadcasted to chat. Each request will attempt to pull from the network items whose names match the chat message; for example, saying \"white ingot\" will make the Index search the network for a single _White Ingot_ and, if found, manifest it as a dropped item. Requests can be quantified: for example, requesting \"10 apples\" will pull up to 10 _Apples_ at once. The word \"this\" will be interpreted as the item currently in the user's hand.

Examples include right before reaching the main menu (during the \"Freezing data\" stage), as well as multiple (!) times when a world is being loaded.\n\nModernFix solves this performance bottleneck by instead making cache rebuilds lazy. Each blockstate rebuilds its cache the first time the data would be accessed. At any point when vanilla or Forge would attempt to rebuild caches for all blockstates, this is redirected to simply invalidate the cache on each blockstate instead.\n\nThis should not have any impact on TPS after startup concludes.","type":"string"},"jade.instrument.didgeridoo":{"description":"Didgeridoo","type":"string"},"fancymenu.helper.placeholder.mouseposy.desc":{"description":"Gets the mouse Y position.\n\n§xAlways returns 10 while in the editor,\n§xso you can still edit the element\n§xwithout it following your mouse when\n§xusing it for advanced sizing/positioning.","type":"string"},"block.quark.oxidized_cut_copper_vertical_slab":{"description":"Oxidized Cut Orange Vertical Slab","type":"string"},"gui.jei.category.salt_evaporation.heat_source.tooltip":{"description":"Heat Source","type":"string"},"gui.tooltips.ae2.Trash":{"description":"Destroy Items","type":"string"},"item.quark.light_gray_rune":{"description":"Light Gray Rune","type":"string"},"structure_block.mode.data":{"description":"Data","type":"string"},"item.railways.track_incomplete_twilightforest_twilight_oak_wide":{"description":"Incomplete Wide Twilight Oak Track","type":"string"},"notes.scope.remote":{"description":"Remote","type":"string"},"block.create.small_asurine_brick_stairs":{"description":"Small Asurine Brick Stairs","type":"string"},"create.recipe.fan_haunting":{"description":"Bulk Haunting","type":"string"},"effect.supplementaries.overencumbered.description":{"description":"Prevents sprinting.
