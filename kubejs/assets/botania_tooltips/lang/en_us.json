As long as the flower receives a redstone signal, it'll step the automaton twice a second. Each location within the flower's 25x25 area of effect counts as a _Cell_.

There're a few small caveats though: the _Endoflame_ will not burn anything that leave byproducts in _Furnaces_ (e.g. _Lava Buckets_, which leave _Buckets_ behind).

The rate of _Mana_ production will also vary with nutrition: it prefers bigger foods. A _Steak_ will produce more _Mana_ than two _Apples_ per-second.
