	#All messages support Minecraft formatting codes (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes).
	#All messages have variables that can be inserted using the following format: ${variableName}
	#The type option controls where the message appears:
	#	SYSTEM: Appears as a message in the chat. (e.g., "Respawn point set")
	#	GAME_INFO: Game information that appears above the hotbar (e.g., "You may not rest now, the bed is too far away").
	#The target option controls to whom the message is sent:
	#	ALL: Sends the message to all players on the server.
	#	DIMENSION: Sends the message to all players in the current dimension.
	#	SLEEPING: Sends the message to all players in the current dimension who are sleeping.
